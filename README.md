OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
The Weather Forecast App is a user-friendly web application designed to provide real-time weather information for any location around the world. This project leverages the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an interactive and visually appealing experience. Users can enter a city name to receive current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.

KEY FEATURES:

1.Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches current weather information from an external weather API.

2.Search Functionality: Allows users to search for weather details by entering the name of a city.

3.Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

4.Dynamic Backgrounds: Changes the background image based on the weather conditions for an immersive user experience.

5.Temperature Conversion: Provides options to view temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

1.HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the app.

2.CSS: Adds styling and layout to ensure a visually appealing and responsive interface.

3.JavaScript: Handles the interactive elements and API integration to fetch and display weather data.

4.OpenWeatherMap API: Supplies the weather data used by the app.

5.Git & GitHub: Version control and project hosting, facilitating collaboration and code management.

HOW IT WORKS:

User Input: Users enter the name of a city in the search bar.

API Request: JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name.

Data Fetching: The app receives the weather data from the API.

Data Display: Weather information is dynamically displayed on the page, including temperature, weather conditions, and more.

Dynamic Background: The background image changes based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).


CONCLUSION:
The Weather Forecast App project has been an invaluable learning experience in web development. It combines practical coding skills with real-world data integration, providing a solid foundation for future projects. This app not only serves a functional purpose but also exemplifies how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be utilized to create dynamic and responsive web applications.
